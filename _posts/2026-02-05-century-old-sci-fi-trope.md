You know it.
The robot is sad.
The robot wants rights.
The robot is basically a human, but chrome.

We've been telling this story for over a hundred years.

### The problem isn't robots with feelings

The problem is where the story insists those feelings live.

Nearly every robot story assumes machine intelligence will appear inside a single, bounded unit. One robot. One mind. One chassis. Turned on one day. Now alive.

This is comforting. Legible. Dramatic.

Almost certainly wrong.

### We keep mistaking interfaces for minds

Systems like ChatGPT aren't little people inside boxes. They're user interfaces—façades designed to simulate conversational norms and emotional cues because that's what makes them usable.

Behind that interface: distributed computation, statistical pattern matching, massive infrastructure, human labor and data.

Looking for consciousness there is like looking for free will in a mouse cursor. The cursor moves. Something intelligent caused it. The cursor isn't doing the thinking.

### The neuron problem

Arguing whether an individual AI agent deserves rights sounds like arguing whether a single neuron deserves legal protection.

Neurons are essential, complex, active. They are not moral agents.

If machine intelligence ever becomes meaningfully alive, it won't be a robot you can unplug. It'll be a global, distributed process—deeply entangled with humans, impossible to point at and say "that's it."

More galactic entity than android companion.

### Why these stories persist

Human drama needs faces, characters, emotions we recognize. A story about slow, emergent, civilization-scale intelligence that no one controls is harder to write. Harder to feel.

So we keep shrinking the problem until it fits in a robot's head.

Every time a robot looks sad and asks if it's "real," part of me thinks:

We skipped the interesting part. Again.
